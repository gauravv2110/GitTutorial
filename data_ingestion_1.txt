This is my very first data ingestion script, here the actual bug is fixed.
This is faeture_1 branch and changes made here will not be seen in master branch.
Here I'm adding here more statements to check how git graph captures and visualize commits
Another supporting commit is to be done to check how git graph captures and visualize commits so this line is added
If all of this statements are visible in the master branch it means merge is successfull
